# Let's Encrypt certificates with hMailServer

This is a repository documenting what has worked for me, how to automate the renewal process and why.  If you do not know what [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is or don't use [hMailServer](https://www.hmailserver.com/) this repository is not for you and these terms will not be explained.  This repository also assumes hMailServer is installed and configured.  It is not a tutorial on using the server.

There are lots of ways to approach the problem of using Let's Encrypt SSL certificates with hMailServer.  This is mine.  I'm not advocating as the best way, just as a way.

## Other assumptions

+ IIS is installed on the same Windows server that host hmail
+ PHP is installed and configured for use by IIS. 
+ [Certify the Web](https://certifytheweb.com/) is installed, configured and you can 
+ PowerShell is installed (Certify the Web can run a PowerShell script when a certificate has been generated)

I am using PHP for at least two reasons:

1. I use the phpWebAdmin tool for hMailServer so PHP is a requirement anyway.
2. It's necessary to extract the certificate and private key from a PFX file generated by Certify the Web and PHP can do this out of the box where PowerShell cannot (not easily anyway) and its then not necessary to use another tool such as openssl.

I am using Certify the Web because:

1. Its a good tool
2. It supports domain authorization so IIS does not have to be open to the public
3. It will renew certificate automatically and
4. It can run a script after certificate generation so the certificate can be applied to hMailServer automatically and the server can be restarted

## Steps to be able to use a certificate with hMailServer

1. Get a certificate PFX
2. Extract the certificate and private key as PEM files
3. Add the certificate and private key to hMailServer
4. Add ports for secure access to SMTP, POP3 and IMAP services and apply the certificate to each service
5. Restart the hMailServer service so it will load up the new certificate

Because Let's Encrypt certificates last only up to 90 days steps 1, 2 and 5 need to be repeated everytime the certificate needs to be replaced so it's best if its automated.  Steps 3 and 4 only apply the first time a certificate is applied.

**Only one certificate is needed even if hMailServer hosts multiple domains.  It is the connection to the server that is being encrypted not emails destined for a specific domain.**

## Installing

Certify the Web creates this folder:

C:\ProgramData\Certify\certes\assets\

which has one existing folder called 'pfx' into which it saves .pfx files containing the generated certificate and private key.  Save the folders and files in this repository to corresponding folders and files under the existing 'assets' folder.  

In practice you can save the files anywhere but these instructions and the scripts assume this location.  If you choose to use an alternative location you will also need to change the path used in the PowerShell [after-generate.ps1](ps/after-generate.ps1) and PHP [extract-certificate.php](php/extract-certificate.php) scripts.

You will also need to edit [after-generate.ps1](ps/after-generate.ps1) to modify the change the location of the PHP executable file.  I installed PHP using the Microsoft Web installer.  If you ave done the same then this file may be in the same location.

## Post processing generated licenses

Next tell Certify the Web how to find the PowerShell script to run once a certificate has been generated.  The screenshot shows the steps to do this:

![Set a Certify the Web script](http://lyquidity-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/github-images/certifytheweb.png)

1. Click the 'advanced options' check box
2. Select the scripting option
3. Select the PowerShell [after-generate.ps1](ps/after-generate.ps1)
4. Test

If there is a .pfx file in the 'pfx' folder then after testing there should be three additional files:

1. cert.pem
2. pkeypem
3. output.txt

The cert.pem and pkey.pem files will be regenerated everytime there is a new certificate .pfx file to process.  These are text files with a specific content layout.

The output.txt file will contain a review of the steps taken to process the .pfx file.  Any errors will be written to the error log device specified in the relevant php.ini file.

## Change hMail

### Add an SSL certificate

With cert.pem and pkey.pem available its time to let hMailServer know about them.  The following screenshot is of part of the hMail administrator's console and included so you can see where to reference these files:

![Set a certificate in hMail administrator](http://lyquidity-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/github-images/hmail-cert.png)

A new certificate entry is added to 'settings->advanced->ssl certificates'.  The name is anything you want that makes sense to you.  The 'Certificate File' text box references the cert.pem file while the 'Private key file' box references the pkey.pem file.

**Only one certificate is needed even if hMailServer hosts multiple domains.  It is the connection to the server that is being encrypted not emails destined for a specific domain.**

### Add new ports

The standard ports used for email are normally:

+ SMTP - 25
+ POP3 - 110
+ IMAP - 143

The ports usually used for encrypted connections are normally:

+ SMTP - 587
+ POP3 - 995
+ IMAP - 993

**Connections on these ports will need to be allowed through the firewall if not already permitted.**

The next screenshot shows the settings for SMTPS.  The port to be used is defined, the port is set to use SSL/TLS and the certificate defined in the previous step is selected.  The same settings are applied to the other mail transfer types being used (with each having its appropriate port number).

## Testing, testing, testing

Assuming everything has been done correctly and the SSL ports allow traffic, its time to test.  A great site for sending test emails is the [Online SMTP tool](smtper.net).

On this site enter your mail server address (should match the address in your certificate), check the 'Use Secured Connection' box and enter a from and to email address.  After solving the simple problem, press the 'Send the test' button.

Do not use email addresses from your domain(s) as the from address.  Often these need to be authenticated and authentication is not needed to complete the test. Instead, make up an address like 'me@mydomain.org' or use a gmail, yahoo or other generic address.
